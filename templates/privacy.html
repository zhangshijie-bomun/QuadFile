    <h1 id="limits">Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>Files are treated as most would expect. They're stored on a server owned by me until they expire. After expiring they're both deleted from storage and cleared from the database, no trails remain. No permanent logs are kept other than nginx's default access logs.</p>
    <p>Otherwise there is no privacy policy. It all depends on how much you trust me not to leak your nudes.</p>

  <h1>
    Access-based storage
  </h1>
  <p>
    {{ page.title }} is a service that keeps files stored depending on their popularity.
  </p>
  <p>
    File storage times are one week from when they were last accessed. Or one week since they were uploaded if they're never accessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meaning that if you upload a file on December 10th and someone accesses that file on the 13th, we won't delete the file until the 20th. If someone also fetched the file on the 17th, your file will stay until December 25th.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a similar fashion; if you upload a file on December 3rd and send it to someone, then the file is never accessed again. It will be deleted on the 10th.

    History
  </h1>
  <p>
  The Cum Zone started out as a bit of a joke between friends after watching a nice video, "Welcome to the Cum Zone" which is available on <a href="https://welcometo.thecum.zone">welcometo.thecum.zone</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    So, after a while I was running the domain "stayawayfrommypersonal.space", which i later sold, after buying this one. I then got to work recreating my site.
  </p>

  <h1>
    The new Cum Zone
  </h1>
  <p>
  After using picturesof.thecum.zone for a while, I decided that keeping the photos saved forever wasn't a good idea, as I am running on a shitty low storage VPS. So I spent a while looking for a good replacement, I found QuadFile, which is pretty damn good. Now I've ported the rest of my small site to quadfile, where it is all on one page.

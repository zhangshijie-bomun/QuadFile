    History
  </h1>
  <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/Volkor3-16/QuadFile">QuadFile</a> is a temporary (or permanent, depending on configuration) file sharing service written in Flask.
  QuadFile was originally started by <a href="https://quad.moe/">quad,</a> who started the project for his own file hosting.
  It was then forked for use by Volkor, who made a few changes to allow for better file filtering, and file name randomization.
